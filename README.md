# Chatbot - A Simple Python Chatbot

Welcome to the **Chatbot** repository! This is a basic Python-based chatbot packaged into an executable file (`chatbot.exe`) for easy use. 

## ðŸš€ About

This chatbot doesn't use advanced AI techniques; it's based on a set of pre-programmed responses to common questions and inputs. The chatbot uses simple conditionals to interact with users and respond to various queries. 

Although itâ€™s not powered by AI, itâ€™s a fun little program to have conversations with, and it can handle questions like:

- "Whatâ€™s your name?"
- "What time is it?"
- "Where am I?"
- "What's the weather?"
- "Say something cool!"

## ðŸ’¡ Contribute Suggestions

Even though this is a simple chatbot, Iâ€™m always looking to improve it! If you have any ideas or suggestions for responses to add, feel free to leave an issue or suggestion in the **Issues** tab of this repository.

Your ideas could help make the chatbot more fun and interactive!

### Some ideas for improvements:
- Adding jokes
- Adding more greetings or ways to say goodbye
- Including trivia questions and answers
- Allowing for custom responses to user input

## ðŸ“¥ How to Use

1. **Download the `.exe` file** from the **Releases** section or directly from this repository.
2. **Run the executable**: Just double-click on `chatbot.exe` to start the chatbot and begin interacting with it through the terminal.
3. **Interact**: Type your questions or greetings and enjoy the conversation!
